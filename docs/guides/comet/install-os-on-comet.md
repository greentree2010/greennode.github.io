title: Install OS on eMMC using SD Card
---

## Introduction
This guide will cover how to install Debian Bookworm, Ubuntu 24.04, Armbian, and Open Media Vault on your COMET using an SD Card. I recommend using at least a 16GB SD Card, and you should have at least a 64GB eMMC storage drive for installation. 


## Debian
We will be using the Debian version created by FriendlyElec. 

### Download the ISO

### Clean the SD Card

### Reset the SD Card

### Install the Image

### Boot the SD Card

### Accessing the OS

## Ubuntu 24.04

## Armbian
:::warning
The CM3588 has "community support" for Armbian. Meaning it may not work and should be used only if the associated risks have been accepted.

## Open Media Vault
